# An introduction to Substra

To enable machine learning on distributed data, four types of objects are defined within a Substra network.

## Objective

It clearly defines the scientific question to be answered with a ML model. It specifies:

- the data format that the **Dataset**, **Algo** and **Model** have to follow,
- the identity of the test data points used to compare and evaluate the models,
- the metrics script which is used to quantify the accuracy of a model.
  
## Dataset

It aggregates numerous data points under a single format. It includes a single *Opener* script which imports and opens the file using libraries specific to the data type.
  
## Algorithm

It corresponds to a script which specifies the method to train a **Model** on a **Dataset**. In particular it specifies the model type and architecture, the loss function, the optimizer, hyperparameters and identifies the parameters that are tuned during training. Algo dependencies are also specified.
  
## Model

It corresponds to a file containing the parameters of a trained model. In the case of neural networks, it gathers the weights of the connections. It is associated with:

### Training tasks specification (*Traintuple*)  

A *Traintuple* specifies which **Algo** must be trained on which **Dataset** for which **Objective** and starting from which **Model(s)**. Once the training is done, it specifies the resulting **Model**.

### Evaluation tasks specification (*Testtuple*)

A **Testtuple** specifies the output of Traintuple to be evaluated. This corresponds to evaluating a **Model** against a (test) **Dataset** associated with an **Objective**.

The core idea of Substra is to keep **Dataset** in the different nodes of a network and make **Algo** and **Models** travel from one node to another to train them on **Dataset**.
